## Enviroment Configuration

The project has been developed entirely with NetBeans (version 8.2), so it is highly recommended to use that to manipulate it, since no other IDE has been tested.

To set up connection to Postgres, you can use rename the file `db.properties.example` on folder `src/` to `db.properties` and add your credentials and local configuration. Since it is a more private data and local configuration, Git should not track that file (see `.gitignore` on the same folder).
